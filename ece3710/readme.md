This is the course description as outlined by UVU:

Explores probability and statistical theory with an emphasis on engineering and computer science applications. Covers descriptive statistics, discrete and continuous random variables, probability distributions, hypothesis testing, expectation, estimation, ANOVA testing, and regression analysis. Includes computer analysis of data and simulation.

Note: Most of the .docx, .png, .pdf, and .xlsx files are designed to compliment the files written in Python as a means of seeing the results (with or without context) of the programs ran. Although the formats evolved over time due to feedback received and changes in grading personel, the files contained here were all written by me and make up nearly the entirety of the files I created for this class.
